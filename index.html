        <p>Hey sweetheart,</p>
        <p>I hope you're doing alright amidst all this chaos. I wanted to share something that's been on my mind - the silence between us is really taking its toll. Not being able to talk to you feels like a heavy weight on my chest, and I find myself missing you every second of the day.</p>
        <p>I want to be open with you, even if it's tough. Sometimes, the things you say can hurt, and I've struggled not to react in a way that might hurt you back. But I've come to realize that what truly matters is finding a way forward together.</p>
        <p>When I think about us, I remember the love and connection that brought us together in the first place. I reached out to you because I saw something special in us, and I still believe in that. So, I want to apologize if I've contributed to the distance between us, and I want to focus on finding a way to make things better.</p>
        <p>I hope that, with time, we can both learn to communicate in a way that strengthens our relationship. I miss you deeply, and I'm hopeful for a future where we can share our thoughts and feelings openly and with care.</p>
        <p>Sending you all my love,</p>
        <p>Love, Bevan</p>
